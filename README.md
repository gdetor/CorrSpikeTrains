# CorrSpikeTrains
A Python class for generating correlated spike trains
--------------

This is a Python class implementation of the methods introduced in: 
**Romain Brette, "Generation of Correlated Spike Trains", Neural Computation 21, 188-215, 2009**.

* The file ``corr_spike_trains.py`` include the main class implementing the Cox processes and the Mixture methods. 
* The file ``example.py`` contains two simple examples of how to use the two methods in order to generate correlated spike    trains.
