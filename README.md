# CorrSpikeTrains
Correlated Spike Trains Python class

This is a Python class implementation of the methods introduced in: 
**Romain Brette, "Generation of Correlated Spike Trains", Neural Computation 21, 188-215, 2009**.

The file ``corr_spike_trains.py`` include the main class for implementing the Cox processes and the Mixture methods. 
The file ``example.py`` contains two simple examples of how to use the two methods in order to generate correlated ddd


spike trains.
